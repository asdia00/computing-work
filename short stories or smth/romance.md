The night was dark in the Imperium. It always was. Cold, dark, filled with terror. Nobody dared to go outside at this time. The last person who did… well, we don’t talk about them. Nobody does. Whether they are even remembered is debatable. Many things that happened in the Imperium were debatable. But nobody debated them. They couldn’t debate them. Not anymore.

The Concilium had ordered the systematic purging of all they deemed to be “heretical” in the name of the Grand Imperator. The Imperial Knights roamed the streets at night. They would watch for the slightest movement in the dark, killing those who didn’t follow the strict curfew. The sound of marching in unison. Left, right, left, right. The sounds stopped. The Imperial Knights, in their dark, metallic armour, have found someone. A scream. A loud crack, as of a broken spine.

This is what Geralt heard in the night, from his dark bedroom. This is what he knew. This is what he saw. In this dark, gloomy, oppressive regime, all he had were his inner thoughts. His mind. His imagination. He dreamed of better worlds. Worlds where everyone was free, where hunger and death didn’t plague the nation constantly. “One day,” he said to himself, under his breath, “One day I’m going to find those worlds.” He said this every night. He wanted this more than anything. For seven years he said this to himself. For seven years, it has only been worse.

War broke out. Famine killed millions. Constant purging took place. The people could not rise. Geralt couldn’t understand why this was the way the world had to be. But… was it? Was it the way the world had to be? He thought about this for days. Weeks. Then he came to a decision.

“I’m going to escape.”

That sentence… those four words… they would be all that he could think of. He went to his job every day, ignoring his coworkers, slacking off on his work. He knew that his destiny was to escape. To be free from the shackles of the Imperium and its multitude of oppressive practices. He would go home, dreaming of freedom beyond the Imperium along the way. He sat down on his bed. He would’ve been at a desk, but those were confiscated by the Imperium due to lack of materials for the military. Geralt thought up plans on how he would escape for hours. After a week’s worth of planning, he had it. He knew how we were going to be free.

It was winter in the Imperium. Geralt had collected all he needed. A shovel, a rope, a diary, and food. It was oddly simple, the number of things he needed. He decided to keep the diary to record his escape attempt for others to see, in the event of him being caught. Wind. Nightfall. The sound of marching.

Left, right, left, right.
The sound of marching slowly grew quieter. It was soon a light tapping heard in the distance. Tap, tap, tap, tap. This was his moment. Geralt peaked his head outside of his window, looking to both sides of the street, to check for any more Imperial Knights. There were none.

He put one leg out, then another. He left through the window. He had officially broken the law of the Imperium. Geralt crouched down, hiding behind anything he could find, whether it was inside an alleyway, behind a trash can, or even upon the branches of a rarely seen tree. He did this for a few miles. He saw the edge of the city ahead. The sight of buildings growing tinier, the smell of nature again. Geralt smiled. “I’m nearly there,” he whispered to himself.

He heard the sound of marching to his left. The repetitive sound of the constant left, right, left, right. He ran into another alleyway. Dark and damp, it was the quickest place to run to.

Left, right, left, right.

The marching grew louder.

Left, right, left, right.

Geralt slowly crept further into the alley, scared of the Imperial Knights.

Left, right, left, right.

They were here.

Left, right, left, right, STOP.

The Knights stopped next to the alleyway, having heard something. Geralt ceased his breathing, covering his mouth, closing his eyes in fear. “Nothing here. Keep moving,” said one of the Knights. Geralt waited for a few seconds until they were further away.

He took a breath and began creeping towards the street again. He paused for a moment and the marching was once again just tapping in the distance. He took a step out and began walking down the street again. A few seconds of him walking passed, then he heard a metallic stepping sound behind him. His heart dropped, his face turned white with fear. He turned around. 

Crack.
