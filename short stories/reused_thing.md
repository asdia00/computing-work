It’s midnight.

Everyone’s asleep. Everyone but you. It’s been hours of crying that’s left your cheeks tear-stained and your
hair a mess. You know what you have to do. It’s an instinct that takes over your whole body. Your mind is
clear, feet leading you to tiptoe in the bathroom as to not wake anyone. There are clothes there, the finest
you could imagine. The whole world is doused in a silvery blue. You pull the shimmering white clothes on.
they look like they were sent from pure heaven. You can’t explain it, but you know they’re for you. They fit
you perfectly.

The moon is shining on you, almost like a spotlight.

But there’s no audience to watch your performance.

As you step outside, you see it. A beach stretched out as far as the eye can see. Your house is gone, the door
you came from is missing. It’s just you and the sky. The stars are like tears hanging in the air, meant just
for you. Like the clothes. Like the beach.

You walk along the shore, watching the water lap at your feet as the melody plays on. Where is it coming
from? No one knows. No one will ever know. There’s no one else to know. It’s only you.

You’re tired. You need to lay down. But there’s nowhere to do so. Instead, you get to your knees and slide
to your back in the water. You look right up at the stars and the moon. They’re yours. Right now, the whole
universe is.

You remember this place. you’ve never been here. It’s familiar, it’s like home. You didn’t belong where you
were. But you’re finally where you’re meant to be.

The light is cast upon you. it fills you up, takes you in. It’s cold, but it’s such a nice feeling. You don’t fight
it, you don’t dare take this world away from your fingertips.

Just like that, the shore rises up again. It doesn’t drown you. just covers you.

It takes you.

You no longer belong to the earth.

You are now a part of the sky.

A part of the stars.

Part of the moon.

The universe.

Welcome home, darling.
